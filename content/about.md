### Hi there! 👋

My name is Dominik Ziaja. I am 21 years old, and my journey in engineering began when I was 12 years old. It all started when my grandpa asked me to take apart an old radio. At the time, I wasn't thinking about anything else just how the radio worked! That moment sparked a deep curiosity in me.

### The beggining of journey

When I was 13, I attempted my first project: building a cotton candy machine. Although it didn’t work well, it pushed me to keep learning. I spent most of my school breaks in the computer lab, and eventually, I asked my parents to buy me my first Arduino kit. That’s when everything really started.

### First serious project

My first real project came at the age of 16. I created a machine called FilFree, which transformed PET bottles into filament for 3D printers. At the time, I couldn’t find any similar open-source machines online, so I had to figure it out myself. Through this project, I learned the basics of 3D modeling, technical drawing, 3D printing, and electronics.

### Milestone in my carrer
Later, I was recognized in the Polish Mechatronics Olympiad and considered patenting my project. The head of Wynalazca.tv and CSTNG (New Generation Technology Learning Center) who also works as a patent advisor was impressed that a 16 year old was so eager to learn. He offered me a job, which was a huge turning point for me.

### The beggining of HandyHelp
Soon after, I began working on a new project: a robotic hand. It was meant to be a simple, quick build, but it completely absorbed me. Over time, it evolved into a bionic prosthetic hand, and that’s how HandyHelp was born. The project continues to develop today.

### First major achievement
After completing the first prototype of the prosthetic hand, I participated in the Explory Young Technology Innovator competition Poland’s leading science fair organized by the Foundation for Advanced Technologies, with strategic partners ORLEN and Polpharma. My project, which reached the national finals, featured a 3D-printed bionic hand prototype with haptic feedback, controlled by velostat sensors. It supported six fundamental human hand grasps, as classified by Schlesinger, and was designed for next-generation biomedical and robotic prosthetic applications.


Today, the bionic hand continues to improve, and in the future, I plan to release it as open source, so anyone can build a prosthetic hand themselves.
