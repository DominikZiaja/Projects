This approach promotes sustainability by repurposing discarded materials into usable printing resources.\nUsed Project Parts List #\rNema17 - Stepper Motor TB6600 - Motor driver REX-C100 - Digital PID Temperature Controller Thermocouple type K 3D printed Planetary Gear Principle of Operation #\rThe machine uses a NEMA 17 stepper motor controlled by TB6600 stepper driver to pull PET plastic strips through a heating block set to 217¬∞C by REX-C100. This temperature ensures the plastic becomes pliable without melting, allowing it to be reshaped into consistent 1.75 mm filament. To handle the required torque, a 3D-printed planetary gear with a 3:1 ratio amplifies the motor‚Äôs pulling force.\nEncountered Problems #\r1. Preprocessing Bottles: #\rPET bottles require pretreatment with compressed air and external heating to achieve a smooth, uniform surface.\n2. Filament Length Limitations: #\rThe process yields 10‚Äì15 meter filament segments, which must be joined for longer prints. The optimal solution involves inserting both ends into a mm metal tube and heating it to 250¬∞C to fuse them seamlessly.\nConclusion #\rThe system achieves a filament diameter tolerance of ¬±0.05 mm, meeting standard 3D printing requirements.

I am 21 years old, and my journey in engineering began when I was 12 years old. It all started when my grandpa asked me to take apart an old radio. At the time, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t thinking about anything else just how the radio worked! That moment sparked a deep curiosity in me.\nThe beggining of journey #\rWhen I was 13, I attempted my first project: building a cotton candy machine. Although it didn‚Äôt work well, it pushed me to keep learning. I spent most of my school breaks in the computer lab, and eventually, I asked my parents to buy me my first Arduino kit. That‚Äôs when everything really started.\nFirst serious project #\rMy first real project came at the age of 16. I created a machine called FilFree, which transformed PET bottles into filament for 3D printers. At the time, I couldn‚Äôt find any similar open-source machines online, so I had to figure it out myself. Through this project, I learned the basics of 3D modeling, technical drawing, 3D printing, and electronics.\nMilestone in my carrer #\rLater, I was recognized in the Polish Mechatronics Olympiad and considered patenting my project. The head of Wynalazca.tv and CSTNG (New Generation Technology Learning Center) who also works as a patent advisor was impressed that a 16 year old was so eager to learn. He offered me a job, which was a huge turning point for me.\nThe beggining of HandyHelp #\rSoon after, I began working on a new project: a robotic hand. It was meant to be a simple, quick build, but it completely absorbed me. Over time, it evolved into a bionic prosthetic hand, and that‚Äôs how HandyHelp was born. The project continues to develop today.\nFirst major achievement #\rAfter completing the first prototype of the prosthetic hand, I participated in the Explory Young Technology Innovator competition Poland‚Äôs leading science fair organized by the Foundation for Advanced Technologies, with strategic partners ORLEN and Polpharma. My project, which reached the national finals, featured a 3D-printed bionic hand prototype with haptic feedback, controlled by velostat sensors. It supported six fundamental human hand grasps, as classified by Schlesinger, and was designed for next-generation biomedical and robotic prosthetic applications.\nToday, the bionic hand continues to improve, and in the future, I plan to release it as open source, so anyone can build a prosthetic hand themselves.\nü§ñ Robotics (especially haptics and bionic prosthetics) üîß Building human-centered tech üìö Learning cutting-edge engineering What\u0026rsquo;s happening now? #\rCurrently, I‚Äôm:\nüéì Pursuing my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s of engineering in Mechatronics degree at Southern Denmark University. üåç Planning an exchange semester in Florida. ü¶æ Research about methods of implementing the movement of the phalanges of the human hand Workin at Hamso engineerng ApS ","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Main Page","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":" Project Overview: Bionic Robotic Hand with Glove-Based Control Using Velostat Sensors #\rProject integrates two distinct components: a bionic robotic prosthetic hand and a sensor equipped control glove. The prosthetic hand is designed to replicate the six primary human grasp patterns as defined by the Schlesinger classification system, ensuring biomechanically accurate functionality.\nThe second component consists of a glove embedded with velostat based flex sensors which enables intuitive, real time manipulation of the robotic hand by translating finger movements into corresponding actuation signals.\nDevelopment Status \u0026amp; Iterations #\rCurrently in the prototyping and refinement phase, the project has undergone significant structural and functional revisions since its inception on June 2, 2022 (02.06.2022). Initially focused on basic phalangeal (finger joint) movements, the scope has expanded considerably to incorporate advanced grasp patterns and improved sensor responsiveness.\nFigure 1: The six basic prehensile patterns defined by Schlesinger (1919) First Prototype #\rThe author apologizes for the lack of professionalism, this is due to the lack of an official video representing the project, the video was recorded in 2023.\nPrinciple of operation #\rThe initial prototype implements a direct tendon driven actuation mechanism for finger flexion, consisting of three primary components:\nActuation System A compact servomotor provides the primary motive force Rotary motion is converted to linear displacement through a disk. Position feedback enables precise angular control Tendon Transmission A high strength synthetic line serves as the flexion tendon The tendon routes through low friction guide channels along the phalanges Distal termination maintains secure attachment while allowing force distribution Biomechanical Implementation The linkage system provides anatomical joint alignment Passive elastic elements assist in extension return Developement of the pchlanges #\rThe mechanical function and desing of the phalanges was considered in order to find the most reliabie prototype.\nFigure 2: Previous prototypes of the phalanges First Prototype: Mechanical Implementation of Flexion Return Mechanism. #\rThe initial prototype utilized a linkage based actuation system, where metal rods were connected through the phalangeal joints via drilled holes. Movement was achieved through a dual spring mechanism:\nExtension Spring (Dorsal Side): Positioned along the posterior aspect of the phalanx, this spring provided the restoring force necessary to return the proximal and intermediate phalanges to their default extended configuration.\nCompression Spring (Palmar Side): Mounted anteriorly along the distal phalanx, this spring assisted in resetting the finger‚Äôs flexed position, ensuring consistent return to the neutral anatomical arrangement.\nThis mechanical configuration enabled basic flexion extension cycles while maintaining structural stability.\nFigure 3: Extension and compression spring phalanx movement Alternative Flexion Return Mechanism #\rTorsional spring Implementation #\rDuring the design phase, the implementation of a torsional spring system was evaluated as an alternative to the linear spring based return mechanism. However, this approach was ultimately abandoned due to the unavailability of a commercially viable torsional spring with an appropriate spring index that met the design‚Äôs torque and spatial constraints.\nElastic Band Implementation #\rCurrently the elastic bands are udner research as a compact alternative to extension springs for passive finger extension. Key advantages include easier integration, tunable tension, and reduced mechanical complexity. Current studies focus on durability under cyclic loading, force consistency, and attachment reliability. This solution maintains existing flexion systems while simplifying the return mechanism.\nSilicone tendon Implementation #\rThe current development phase focuses on advancing biomimetic articulation through a tendon system embedded in cast silicone. Utilizing RTV2 SF33 silicone (Shore hardness: 33A), this iteration addresses prior mechanical limitations by leveraging the material‚Äôs key properties:\nHigh Tear Resistance Excellent Flow Characteristics Satisfactory for intricate molds and skin-safe applications. Second Prototype: Principle of operation #\rAnother implementation of movement system between the joints instead of shaft between them is the the rolling contact/compliant. Rolling contact and compliant joints are mechanisms that combine the benefits of rolling contact (low friction), with the flexibility of compliant mechanisms, which use elastic deformation rather than rigid parts. These joints are designed to allow movement with minimal friction and wear, often by using surfaces that roll against each other, held together by compliant elements like flexible bands or strips.\nFigure 4: Rolling contact joints Glove Controller #\rThe glove controller was designed to enhance user immersion during prosthetic hand operation. It integrates flex sensors constructed from Velostat layered between conductive copper traces, enabling motion detection. Future iterations will incorporate tactile vibration actuators to provide haptic feedback, further improving sensory integration and control realism. The system calculates finger bend angle by measuring Velostat resistance changes, where maximum resistance corresponds to a straight finger and minimum resistance to full flexion, enabling continuous angle mapping through proportional interpolation between these calibrated endpoints.\nRobotic hand controlled by a Velostat sensor glove #\rThe author apologizes for the lack of professionalism, this is due to the lack of an official video representing the project, the video was recorded in 2023.

Everything was made by our group including:\nMathematical model FEA Simulation Simulink Simulation Control, Sensor and Code Developement Due to the report submission deadline and requirement to return parts the drone was not at it\u0026rsquo;s final stage which was the hoovering position.\nInformations about the report. #\r136 A4 pages written with Latex (Overleaf) 83 Bibliography links where a significant number are research papers 104 Equations Project and report was made within 4 months Figure 1: Gimbal Mechanism for Stability Testing\rFigure 2: Stress Distribution from FEA\rFigure 3: Final Frame Design in X Configuration\rFigure 4: Total Deformation Under Load\rProject Parts List #\rArduino BLE 33 rev2 BLDC motor iFlight XING X1504 3100KV Uranus 35A BLHeli_32 Single ESC By Skystars Gemfan Hurricane 3520 3-Blade Propeller for 3.5 Gens Ace Tattu 2300mAh battery Sensor Fusion #\rSensor fusion is defined as the combination of two or more data sources to enhance the consistency, accuracy, and dependability of a system. These data sources may include mathematical models that encode knowledge from the physical world into the fusion algorithm to improve sensor measurements. Sensor fusion improves data quality by reducing noise using multiple sensors and varying sensor types. In addition, it increases system reliability by compensating for the limitations of individual sensors.\nIMU Integration in Sensor Fusion #\rIn the project the internal IMU (BMI270) and magnetometer (BMM150) on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Rev2 was utilized to estimate the orientation of the system. An IMU combines an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer which together enable motion tracking. Orientation is defined as a rotational transformation that describes the deviation of an object from a predefined reference frame.\nThe focus narrowed to the complementary and Kalman filters, which were compared and adapted to the drone project‚Äôs requirements. The advantages and disadvantages of each were considered [1]\nComparison of Advantages #\rKalman Filter #\rHandles unreliable measurements Adapts to system changes Predicts future system states Suitable for complex dynamic models Complementary Filter #\rSimple implementation Low computational cost Stable and reliable in real-world conditions System can be non-linear Noise distribution does not have to be Gaussian Ultimately, the complementary filter was selected as the primary solution due to its computational efficiency and alignment with the drone project‚Äôs needs. Key reasons include:\nComputational efficiency [2] ‚ÄúAs an advantage, the algorithmic simplicity makes the complementary filter the best choice for embedded applications, where not much computational power is available‚Äú Studies show that [3] ‚Äúthe prediction error for all filters kept inside ¬±2.5 degrees indicated that these techniques performed effectively‚Äù under non-disturbance conditions (standard rotations) which can be treated as reference to hovering of the drone. Since our drone prioritizes stable flight over complex and rabid movements, this level of precision is acceptable. Additional notes #\rThe equations that were used in the development of a complementary filter for drone attitude estimation can be found here.\nComplementary Filter In Simulink #\rAfter implementing data acquisition data was executed and loaded to workspace by Matlab commands. The discrete solver with fixed step type (set to 0.01 fundamental sample time) was selected due to the compatibility with control development.\nFigure 5: Pitch Estimation\rComplementary Filter system explanation #\rGyroscope #\rgyroDatafromworkspace provides earlier gathered data from matlab. Demux splits the data to 3 separate signals.

A drift-corrected, smoothed pitch estimation Results #\rIn the provided images, the parameter Œ± was set to 0.98, based on empirical evidence, this parameter value achieves the best results, complementary filter effectively attenuated accelerometer noise, achieving a significant reduction and filter successfully mitigated drift.\nFollowing data acquisition comprising 420 discrete angular measurements during the terminal 5-second stabilization phase of the experimental trial, the following attitude parameters were obtained:\nFigure 6: Statistical metrics from the stabilization phase\rFigure 7: Accelerometer,Gyroscope,Roll Estimation\rFigure 8: Accelerometer,Gyroscope,Pitch Estimation\rKey challenges and solutions affecting sensor system performance #\rRotations induce centripetal accelerations on off-centre IMUs, corrupting attitude estimation. To minimize this, the IMU was positioned to the drone‚Äôs centre of rotation (centre of gravity). While perfect alignment with the centre of gravity is challenging due to payload distribution and physical constraints, geometric centre, it significantly reduces rotational artifacts in the accelerometer data.\nInertia Measurement System noise and structural vibrations [4], [5], [6]. It is stated that [5] ‚ÄúDeterministic noise arises due to such factors as misalignmentof the sensor chip during fabrication, static bias or scale factor errors‚Äù, to determine these errors the calibration procedures has been performed. [4] ‚ÄúAccording to the analysis of the mechanical structure and noise characteristicsof quad-rotor UAVs, the radiated noise of UAVs mainly comes from rotarywings and brushless motors‚Äù, The complementary filter allowed for partial noise reduction, improving the stability of orientation estimation, but full optimization would require additional hardware and algorithmic modifications that were not implemented as part of the project.\nThe main components where magnetic fields play a significant role is an brushless motors (motors generate time-varying electromagnetic fields during the operation) and ESCs (high-frequency magnetic noise from rapid PulseWidth Modulation switching to control motor speed). To mitigate magnetic interference with the magnetometer, one method (as shown in Figure 1 of [7] is to maximize the distance between the magnetometer and noise sources. In this design, individual ESCs were mounted on the drone‚Äôs arms, physically separating them from the magnetometer. This reduces direct magnetic coupling and improves heading accuracy\nBias correction and calibration #\rGyroscope Bias Correction #\rGyroscope bias correction constitutes a critical preprocessing step in inertial measurement systems, particularly for applications requiring precise orientation estimation. These biases manifest as angular rate offsets that, when integrated over time, lead to unbounded growth in attitude estimation error. The bias calculation algorithm implemented the correction process through the following computational steps:\nCollected 2000 samples per axis (x,y,z) Calculated mean offset for each axis Subtracted biases from real-time measurements Accelerometer Bias Correction #\rAccelerometer bias correction is essential for accurate gravity vector estimation, particularly in attitude determination systems where tilt accuracy directly impacts flight stability. These biases introduce static tilt errors that propagate into orientation estimates, compromising the drone‚Äôs ability to maintain level flight. The bias correction algorithm implemented the calibration process through the following steps:\nRecorded 500 stationary samples per axis Compared x/y axes to 0g reference, z-axis to 1g gravity Applied offsets to all incoming measurements Magnetometer Calibration #\rMagnetometer calibration represents a critical preprocessing step in attitude estimation systems due to the sensor‚Äôs susceptibility to both hard-iron (permanent magnetic fields) and soft-iron (magnetic properties of materials surrounding the magnetometer) magnetic disturbances. The BMM150 magnetometer integrated in the Arduino 33 BLE Rev2 exhibits particularly pronounced sensitivity to environmental interference, with uncompensated biases. The calibration routine was based on 8 and implemented through the following procedure:\nUsed MATLAB to stream data at 115200 baud Rotated IMU in figure-8 pattern (10 sec, 1000 samples) Ensured full spherical coverage for accurate calibration Figure 9: Magnetometer data visualisation after calibration\rAdditional Images #\rFigure 10: Pitch, Roll and Yaw estimation structure\rFigure 11: Holder Figure 12: Data logging\rFigure 13: Testing setup: Above caption\rFigure 14: Testing setup: Side caption\rFigure 15:Linear system, controller Figure 16: Motor Mixing block\rFigure 17: Non-LinearSystem\rFigure 18: Data acquisition python script\r","date":"15 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/mysecondpost/","section":"Posts","summary":"Development of a Drone Using a Custom Arduino-Based Flight Controller with Simulink-Implemented Control System","title":"X Configuration Drone","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
